# Parnassus Navigator v1.6.5.3

Your code at your fingertips. Ever wanted to jump to the uses clause,
to a class’s constructor, to a property definition?
Navigator lets you move between any section of code quickly, easily,
and without your fingers leaving the keyboard. There’s also a minimap –
a miniature version of your code, showing the structure and letting you
scroll just like a scrollbar. This plugin used to be Parnassus Navigator.
